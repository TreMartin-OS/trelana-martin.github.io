## Git commands - to save changes back to GitHub
1) In your terminal, type => git add -A
2) In your terminl, type => git commit -m "describe the work you have completed"
3) In your terminal, type => git push
(Run these often, this is how you SAVE your word to GitHub. 
We have 50 hours & when they're gone we'll create a new account.
So we need to save all old work to Github constantly so you dont lose anything.
If you dont save you'll have to pay to get access to your code.)

(Could maybe attempt more but its over stuff we will cover later.)
(When assignments are done, send a screenshot to the instructor on Greenlight/Slack)
(Don't forget to do the Syllabus quiz before class on Monday.)
