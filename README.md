## Git commands - to save changes back to GitHub
1) In your terminal, type => git add -A
2) In your terminl, type => git commit -m "describe the work you have completed"
3) In your terminal, type => git push  <br>
<p>
(Run these often, this is how you SAVE your word to GitHub.  <br>
We have 50 hours & when they're gone we'll create a new account. <br>
So we need to save all old work to Github constantly so you dont lose anything. <br>
If you dont save you'll have to pay to get access to your code.) <br>
